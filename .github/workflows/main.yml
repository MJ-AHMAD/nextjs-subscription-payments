It looks like the file `.github/workflows/main.yml` doesn't exist yet. Here is a basic workflow configuration for your Next.js subscription payments project:

```yaml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      with:
        node-version: '16'

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm install

    - name: Build project
      run: npm run build

    - name: Run tests
      run: npm test
```

You can copy this content into the `.github/workflows/main.yml` file in your repository.
